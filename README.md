# Multiple Sleeping Barbers

This is a C++ program that solves the classic sleeping barber problem with the added complexity of multiple barbers.

Each barber is simulated with a different execution thread.

## The Sleeping Barber Problem

The barbershop has several barbers that can each help one customer. Each cut takes a certain amount of time and there is a waiting room with a limited number of chairs. Customers show up for a cut and if no barber or waiting room chair is available they leave the shop without service.
